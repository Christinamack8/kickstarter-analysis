# Kickstarter Analysis  
## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover some trends 

## Analysis and Challenges
My main challenges included figuring out the Countifs function to determine the Outcomes based on goals.  My formula's were not working as well as I missed a line row containing one of the ranges causing my chart to look off. All of the criteria's needed to be added which took me a while to figure out.

Dates needed to be converted and column added to create the year.  Subcategory was added and Parent Category was filtered out.  

## Outcomes based on Theater Launch Date Charts

There were zero successful campaigns with goals  between 45000 to 49999.  Campaigns with goals less than 1000 were almost 80% successful.
